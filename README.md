# CalcLite

## Description :

Implementation of a simple C calculator with basic operations

## Why this code?

This code allows you to learn the basics of the C language through a simple calculator that supports the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations.
The program uses the `scanf` functions for user input and `switch` to select the desired operation.

____

- Adding functions for the four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Error management for zero division.
- Use of `scanf` to recover the numbers and the chosen operation.
- Use of a Switch` Block to select and execute the operation.
